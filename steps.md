Project requirements

You should implement the following interactions:

- When the user clicks (or taps) the button to check project details, the popup with details about the project appears. - DONE
- When the user clicks (or taps) the close (X) button, the popup disappears. - DONE
â€¢ In order to associate each project with the popup window details, you must refactor the project section:

a. You need to use a JavaScript array to store all of the information for all projects. - DONE
b. For each project you need to store the following pieces of data in a JavaScript object, at a minimum: name, description, featured image, technologies, link to live version, link to source. - DONE
c. You need to update the main page so that the projects section is created dynamically using the information stored in that JavaScript object. Remember, all of the HTML in that section is created when the page loads.
d. After that, you could implement the popup window.
e. You should implement popups for both mobile and desktop screen sizes:
